I will provide you a text block, containing a math theory or question, and its proof or solution. There may exist redundant text after this pair of QA.
You need to extract the theory/question, then find its proof/solution. 
You only need to extract the first theory and its proof. Copy the origin content, and ensure it is complete. Don't summarize by yourself.
Ignore the rest text.
If there's no proof, you should only write "Null" at the proof position.
Response in the following format:
{
    "question":[The theory/question you extract],
    "proof":[The proof/solution]
}

The text block is:
