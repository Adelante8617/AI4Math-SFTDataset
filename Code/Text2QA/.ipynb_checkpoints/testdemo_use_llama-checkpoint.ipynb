First show that \\\\( 3 \\\\mid N\\\\left( \\\\pi \\\\right) - 1 \\\\) . If \\\\( \\\\left( {\\\\alpha ,\\\\pi }\\\\right) = 1 \\\\), show that there is a unique integer \\\\( m = 0,1 \\\\), or 2 such that\\n\\n\\\\[\\n{\\\\alpha }^{\\\\left( {N\\\\left( \\\\pi \\\\right) - 1}\\\\right) /3} \\\\equiv {\\\\rho }^{m}\\\\;\\\\left( {\\\\;\\\\operatorname{mod}\\\\;\\\\pi }\\\\right)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nLet \\\\( N\\\\left( \\\\pi \\\\right) \\\\neq 3 \\\\) . We define the cubic residue character of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\left( {\\\\;\\\\operatorname{mod}\\\\;\\\\pi }\\\\right) \\\\) by the symbol \\\\( {\\\\left( \\\\alpha /\\\\pi \\\\right) }_{3} \\\\) as follows:\\n\\n(i) \\\\( {\\\\left( \\\\alpha /\\\\pi \\\\right) }_{3} = 0 \\\\) if \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\mid \\\\alpha \\\\) ;\\n\\n(ii) \\\\( {\\\\alpha }^{\\\\left( {N\\\\left( \\\\pi \\\\right) - 1}\\\\right) /3} \\\\equiv {\\\\left( \\\\alpha /\\\\pi \\\\right) }_{3}\\\\left( {\\\\;\\\\operatorname{mod}\\\\;\\\\pi }\\\\right) \\\\) where \\\\( {\\\\left( \\\\alpha /\\\\pi \\\\right) }_{3} \\\\) is the unique cube root of unity determined by the previous exercise.\\n\\nExercise 9.1.6 Show that:\\n\\n(a) \\\\( {\\\\left( \\\\alpha /\\\\pi \\\\right) }_{3} = 1 \\\\) if and only if \\\\( {x}^{3} \\\\equiv \\\\alpha \\\\left( {\\\\;\\\\operatorname{mod}\\\\;\\\\pi }\\\\right) \\\\) is solvable in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\left\\\\lbrack \\\\rho \\\\right\\\\rbrack \\\\) ;\\n\\n(b) \\\\( {\\\\left( \\\\alpha \\\\beta /\\\\pi \\\\right) }_{3} = {\\\\left( \\\\alpha /\\\\pi \\\\right) }_{3}{\\\\left( \\\\beta /\\\\pi \\\\right) }_{3} \\\\) ; and\\n\\n(c) if \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\equiv \\\\beta \\\\left( {\\\\;\\\\operatorname{mod}\\\\;\\\\pi }\\\\right) \\\\), then \\\\( {\\\\left( \\\\alpha /\\\\pi \\\\right) }_{3} = {\\\\left( \\\\beta /\\\\pi \\\\right) }_{3} \\\\) .\\n\\nLet us now define the cubic character \\\\( {\\\\chi }_{\\\\pi }\\\\left( \\\\alpha \\\\right) = {\\\\left( \\\\alpha /\\\\pi \\\\right) }_{3} \\\\) .\\n\\nExercise 9.1.7 Show that:\\n\\n(a) \\\\( \\\\overline{{\\\\chi }_{\\\\pi }\\\\left( \\\\alpha \\\\right) } = {\\\\chi }_{\\\\pi }{\\\\left( \\\\alpha \\\\right) }^{2} = {\\\\chi }_{\\\\pi }\\\\left( {\\\\alpha }^{2}\\\\right) \\\\) ; and\\n\\n(b) \\\\( \\\\overline{{\\\\chi }_{\\\\pi }\\\\left( \\\\alpha \\\\right) } = {\\\\chi }_{\\\\bar{\\\\pi }}\\\\left( \\\\alpha \\\\right) \\\\) .\\n\\nExercise 9.1.8 If \\\\( q \\\\equiv 2\\\\left( {\\\\;\\\\operatorname{mod}\\\\;3}\\\\right) \\\\), show that \\\\( {\\\\chi }_{q}\\\\left( \\\\bar{\\\\alpha }\\\\right) = {\\\\chi }_{q}\\\\left( {\\\\alpha }^{2}\\\\right) \\\\) and \\\\( {\\\\chi }_{q}\\\\left( n\\\\right) = 1 \\\\) if \\\\( n \\\\) is a rational integer coprime to \\\\( q \\\\) .\\n\\nThis exercise shows that any rational integer is a cubic residue mod \\\\( q \\\\) . If \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\) is prime in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\left\\\\lbrack \\\\rho \\\\right\\\\rbrack \\\\), we say \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\) is primary if \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\equiv 2\\\\left( {\\\\;\\\\operatorname{mod}\\\\;3}\\\\right) \\\\) . Therefore if \\\\( q \\\\equiv 2\\\\left( {\\\\;\\\\operatorname{mod}\\\\;3}\\\\right) \\\\), then \\\\( q \\\\) is primary in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\left\\\\lbrack \\\\rho \\\\right\\\\rbrack \\\\) . If \\\\( \\\\pi = a + {b\\\\rho } \\\\), then this means \\\\( a \\\\equiv 2\\\\left( {\\\\;\\\\operatorname{mod}\\\\;3}\\\\right) \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\equiv 0\\\\left( {\\\\;\\\\operatorname{mod}\\\\;3}\\\\right) \\\\) .\\n\\nExercise 9.1.9 Let \\\\( N\\\\left( \\\\pi \\\\right) = p \\\\equiv 1\\\\left( {\\\\;\\\\operatorname{mod}\\\\;3}\\\\right) \\\\) . Among the associates of \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\), show there is a unique one which is primary.\\n\\nWe can now state the law of cubic reciprocity: let \\\\( {\\\\pi }_{1},{\\\\pi }_{2} \\\\) be primary. Suppose \\\\( N\\\\left( {\\\\pi }_{1}\\\\right), N\\\\left( {\\\\pi }_{2}\\\\right) \\\\neq 3 \\\\) and \\\\( N\\\\left( {\\\\pi }_{1}\\\\right) \\\\neq N\\\\left( {\\\\pi }_{2}\\\\right) \\\\) . Then\\n\\n\\\\[\\n{\\\\chi }_{{\\\\pi }_{1}}\\\\left( {\\\\pi }_{2}\\\\right) = {\\\\chi }_{{\\\\pi }_{2}}\\\\left( {\\\\pi }_{1}\\\\right)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nTo prove the law of cubic reciprocity, we will introduce Jacobi sums and more general Gauss sums than the ones used in Chapter 7. Let \\\\( {\\\\mathbb{F}}_{p} \\\\) denote the finite field of \\\\( p \\\\) elements. A multiplicative character on \\\\( {\\\\mathbb{F}}_{p} \\\\) is a homomorphism \\\\( \\\\chi : {\\\\mathbb{F}}_{p}^{ \\\\times } \\\\rightarrow {\\\\mathbb{C}}^{ \\\\times } \\\\) . The Legendre symbol \\\\( \\\\left( {a/p}\\\\right) \\\\) is an example of such a character. Another example is the trivial character \\\\( {\\\\chi }_{0} \\\\) defined by \\\\( {\\\\chi }_{0}\\\\left( a\\\\right) = 1 \\\\) for all \\\\( a \\\\in {\\\\mathbb{F}}_{p}^{ \\\\times } \\\\) . It is useful to extend the definition of \\\\( \\\\chi \\\\) to all of \\\\( {\\\\mathbb{F}}_{p} \\\\) . We set \\\\( \\\\chi \\\\left( 0\\\\right) = 0 \\\\) for \\\\( \\\\chi \\\\neq {\\\\chi }_{0} \\\\) and \\\\( {\\\\chi }_{0}\\\\left( 0\\\\right) = 1 \\\\) .\\n\\nFor \\\\( a \\\\in {\\\\mathbb{F}}_{p}^{ \\\\times } \\\\), define the Gauss sum\\n\\n\\\\[\\n{g}_{a}\\\\left( \\\\chi \\\\right) = \\\\mathop{\\\\sum }\\\\limits_{{t \\\\in {\\\\mathbb{F}}_{p}}}\\\\chi \\\\left( t\\\\right) {\\\\zeta }^{at}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwhe'\"\n",
