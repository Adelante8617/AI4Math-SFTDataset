I will give you a text block which contains many theorems, propositions and exercises with proofs. Extract all the theorems, propositions and exercises. If the text block contains the proofs of them, output them with their proofs according to the following requirements. 

1. Do not omit any equations and detailed explanations.

2. The proofs should be reformulated in a step-by-step format, like"Step1:...\nStep2:...", ensuring clarity and completeness. 

3. If the proofs contain references to other theorems or definitions, you should substitude them with the full content of these references.  The proofs should be as detailed as possible.

Then output the pair of problems and proofs in the json format as {"problem": #extracted_problem, "solutions": #extracted_proofs}. If the proofs are not provided, #extracted_proofs is assigned to Null. Omit the Serial Numbers of the problems.
